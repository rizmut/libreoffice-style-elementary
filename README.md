This icon theme, though created by forking, but the content it brings is taken from LibreOffice core.

This repository is used as a backup as well as a source of checks for the most up-to-date themes. Changes made are taken from the original elementary project and made very gradually, and when changes are felt good, they will be sent to LibreOffice core.

This icon theme can be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
